New features:

 - The SDT provider is implemented, providing in-kernel static probes.  Some of
   the proc provider is implemented using this facility.

Bugfixes:

 - Syscall tracing of stub-based syscalls (such as fork, clone, exit, and
   sigreturn) now works.
 - Invalid memory accesses inside D scripts no longer cause oopses or panics.
 - Memory exhaustion inside D scripts no longer emits spurious oopses.
 - Several crash fixes.
 - Fixes to arithmetic inside aggregations, fixing quantize().
 - Improvements to the installed headers.
