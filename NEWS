0.2.5
-----

New features:

 - libdtrace is now a shared library, just as on OpenSolaris, with a very
   similar API.  No API or ABI compatibility guarantees are made regarding
   this library, at present.


0.2
---

New features:

 - The SDT provider is implemented, providing in-kernel static probes.  Some of
   the proc provider is implemented using this facility.

Bugfixes:

 - Syscall tracing of stub-based syscalls (such as fork, clone, exit, and
   sigreturn) now works.
 - Invalid memory accesses inside D scripts no longer cause oopses or panics.
 - Memory exhaustion inside D scripts no longer emits spurious oopses.
 - Several crash fixes.
 - Fixes to arithmetic inside aggregations, fixing quantize().
 - Improvements to the installed headers.


0.1
---

First release. Working components:

 - the entire D language, with the exception of parts that depend on
   symbol lookup or CTF

 - the syscall provider (with the exception of the clone probe, which
   is disabled)

 - the profile provider (with the exception of arbitrary-precision
   profile timers).

 - kernel stack tracebacks, but ustack() prints addresses only, no symbols

Major components not yet present include all the other providers, including sdt
and usdt.
