Linux DTrace v0.2 for x86_64 Oracle Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel 2.6.39
------------

This is the official Linux port of the advanced tracing tool DTrace.  It relies
on a userspace component, a CDDLed kernel module, and a few changes in the
kernel.

The following components work, so far:

 - the entire D language, with the exception of parts that depend on symbol
   lookup or CTF

 - the syscall provider

 - the profile provider (with the exception of arbitrary-precision profile
   timers).

 - the sdt provider, supplying an implementation of the proc provider, with most
   probes present

 - kernel stack tracebacks, but ustack() prints addresses only, no symbols

Major components not yet present include all the other providers, including
usdt.
